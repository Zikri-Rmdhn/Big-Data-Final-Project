# ðŸŽµ Big Data Final Project: Spotify Playlist Generation

### Project Overview
This project aims to **recreate Spotify playlists** using various **unsupervised learning algorithms** to group songs with similar characteristics.  
The dataset used in this project was obtained from [Kaggle: Spotify Audio Features](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tomigelo/spotify-audio-features).

### Group Members
- Sandhika Surya Ardianto  
- Muhammad Zikri Ramadhan *(me)*  

### Methods
We experimented with several clustering techniques to identify patterns within the dataset:
1. **K-Means**
2. **Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)**
3. **DBSCAN**

### My Contributions
In this project, I was mainly responsible for:
- **Clustering & Parameter Tuning**  
  Implemented unsupervised learning algorithms (K-Means, GMM, DBSCAN), performed hyperparameter tuning (e.g., optimal cluster selection using silhouette score and elbow method), and optimized clustering results.  

- **Cluster Analysis & Interpretation**  
  Analyzed the characteristics of each cluster by examining audio features (e.g., danceability, energy, tempo) to provide meaningful insights on how songs are grouped and how they resemble actual Spotify playlists.  

- **Project Documentation**  
  Co-authored the final project report, documenting methodology, experiment results, and key findings. [^1]

### Presentation & Storytelling
In the presentation, we structured our work as a **data storytelling exercise**. We began by introducing the goal of the project and providing an overview of the dataset, including its main features. Next, we explained the steps we took in **EDA, preprocessing, and feature engineering**, highlighting the transformations applied to make the dataset more informative. We then presented the **clustering methods** we applied, followed by the results. I specifically described the characteristics of each cluster by analyzing the top songs within them and linking these to particular genres and feature patterns. Finally, we compared the results of all three methods and concluded which one produced the most coherent and meaningful playlist. This process not only showcased our technical workflow but also allowed us to practice **communicating insights effectively through data storytelling**.
