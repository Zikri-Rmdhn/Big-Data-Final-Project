# ðŸŽµ Big Data Final Project: Spotify Playlist Generation

### Project Overview
This project aims to **recreate Spotify playlists** using various **unsupervised learning algorithms** to group songs with similar characteristics.  
The dataset used in this project was obtained from [Kaggle: Spotify Audio Features](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tomigelo/spotify-audio-features).

### Group Members
- Sandhika Surya Ardianto  
- Muhammad Zikri Ramadhan *(me)*  

### Methods
We experimented with several clustering techniques to identify patterns within the dataset:
1. **K-Means**
2. **Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)**
3. **DBSCAN**

### My Contributions
In this project, I was mainly responsible for:
- **Clustering & Parameter Tuning**  
  Implemented unsupervised learning algorithms (K-Means, GMM, DBSCAN), performed hyperparameter tuning (e.g., optimal cluster selection using silhouette score and elbow method), and optimized clustering results.  

- **Cluster Analysis & Interpretation**  
  Analyzed the characteristics of each cluster by examining audio features (e.g., danceability, energy, tempo) to provide meaningful insights on how songs are grouped and how they resemble actual Spotify playlists.  

- **Project Documentation**  
  Co-authored the final project report, documenting methodology, experiment results, and key findings in a structured academic format. [^1]
